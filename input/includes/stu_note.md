#### Draft HL7 AU Patient Summary for Proof of Concept

This Implementation Guide has been created as a proof of concept to explore modelling options and tooling configurations. It is not intended for implementation or further progression and does not represent an official HL7 AU publication.

The purpose of this guide is to evaluate potential approaches for aligning with  AU Core and IPS and to inform future development efforts. Feedback on this guide is not required, as it serves solely as an internal exploratory resource.

For information on the official HL7 AU Patient Summary Implementation Guide, please refer to [AU Patient Summary FHIR IG Project page](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HAFWG/AU+Patient+Summary+FHIR+IG+Project).
