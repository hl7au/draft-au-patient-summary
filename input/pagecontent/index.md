### Introduction
This version of the HL7 AU Patient Summary Implementation Guide was created as part of a tooling test to explore modelling options. It is not intended for further development or progression.

This draft is based on the International Patient Summary (IPS) specification and AU Core.

The official HL7 AU Patient Summary Implementation Guide will be developed and progressed in a separate repository.
