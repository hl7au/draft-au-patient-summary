# === WARNING: These are warnings for publication artefacts not used in HL7 AU specifications at this time and are accepted by the AU FHIR WG. ===  
The HTML fragment 'ip-statements.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
An HTML fragment from the set [cross-version-analysis.xhtml, cross-version-analysis-inline.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
The HTML fragment 'globals-table.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide

# === WARNING: Artefacts inherit multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier) from AU Base. The IG Publisher cannot match example instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU Core and AU Base. ===
